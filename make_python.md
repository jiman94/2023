# Here is a sample Makefile for building a Python program with a Dockerfile:

#### Makefile

```shell 
# the name of the image
IMAGE_NAME=my_python_image

# build all the things
all: build

# build the docker image
build:
	docker build -t $(IMAGE_NAME) .

# run the docker image
run: build
	docker run -it $(IMAGE_NAME)

# clean up the docker image
clean:
	docker rmi $(IMAGE_NAME)
```

# Here is a sample Dockerfile for a Python program:

```dockefile
# base image
FROM python:3.9

# working directory
WORKDIR /app

# copy the requirements file
COPY requirements.txt .

# install dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# set the command to run when the container starts
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```
