# Here is a list of common rules in SonarQube for secure coding:

Input validation: Checks if user input is properly validated before being used in the application.

Authentication and authorization: Checks if proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive information.

SQL injection: Checks if proper measures are in place to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Cross-site scripting (XSS): Checks if proper measures are in place to prevent XSS attacks.

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF): Checks if proper measures are in place to prevent CSRF attacks.

Session management: Checks if session data is properly protected, encrypted and secured.

Cryptographic algorithm: Checks if cryptographic algorithms are used correctly and securely.

Error handling and logging: Checks if error handling and logging mechanisms are in place and properly used to detect and respond to security incidents.

Hard-coded credentials: Checks if hard-coded credentials such as passwords, secret keys or API keys are present in the code.

File access: Checks if file access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data stored in files.

Note: This is not an exhaustive list and the specific rules may vary based on the version and plugins of SonarQube used.
